if you want to create a new widget, you have to follow some steps.

1. add the widget options.
    - this is the options you can edit in the editor. for example if you want to add a new container, you have to add a width and height parameter, as well as a padding, margin and alignment. however its your choice what you want to add and what not.
    - make sure to register it by calling .register()!
    - you can also add a list of options, but if you do that, you can only chose one of the options and nothing else!
    - make sure that the default value is convertable with the parse method. for example as an alignment you have to write the string "Alignment.center" instead of just "center"!

2. sometimes you have to add a new parse method
    - sometimes the option you added is of a type that cant be converted to a string yet
    - for example if it takes an enum value of CrossAxisAlignment and there is no parseCrossAxisAlignment method yet, you have to create it! you can do that in the widget_options.dart file
    - make sure it takes a dynamic value as an input and returns a nullable value of the type you want to parse to as an output
    - it has to be able to convert a string / Map<String, dynamic>. look at some of the other parse methods for more details

3. add the actual build method (in the widget_builder.dart file)
    - that's the method that returns a Layout widget.
    - it takes a Map<String, dynamic> as an input
    - it contains all of the data.
    - make sure to set the default values if the value of some of the parameters is null
    - also make sure to convert all of the coordinates / sizes into absolute coordinates
    - all those values are in a range from 0 to 1, 0 being the start and 1 the end of the screen
    - for example 0.5 is the middle of the screen
    - look at other build methods for more info

4. add it to the import / export types
    - in the json_exporter file, theres 2 methods that switch over every possible widget type
    - make sure yours is there too
    - also make sure to pass the properties like the others do

5. add the popup menu item (in the gui_editor.dart file)
    - this is the popup menu item that appears in the add widget menu
    - its a text and an icon
    - also make sure to add the widget to the root when its clicked. under all the popup menu items theres a switch for that
